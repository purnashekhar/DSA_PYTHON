# 📘 DSA for Data Analysts

A curated and simplified **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** syllabus **specifically designed for Data Analyst roles**.
This roadmap focuses only on the concepts and problems that are *actually required* in Data Analyst interviews and coding tests.

---

## ✅ Overview

Data Analyst interviews do **NOT** require advanced DSA like Trees, Graphs, DP, or Tries.
This syllabus contains **only the essential topics**, making it efficient and practical.

---

## 📌 A. Basics (Start From Scratch)

* Programming fundamentals
* Variables & Data Types
* Loops & Conditions
* Functions
* Time Complexity (Big-O notation — basic only)

---

## 📌 B. Core Required DSA Topics (Must Learn)

These topics are **important and 100% enough** for Data Analyst roles:

### **1. Arrays**

* Traversal, insert/delete, max/min
* Searching basics
* Sorting basics
* Two-pointer
* Sliding window
* Prefix sum

---

### **2. Strings**

* Palindrome
* Anagram
* Character frequency
* Substrings basics

---

### **3. Sorting**


* Bubble, Selection, Insertion (concepts)
* Quick Sort, Merge Sort (concepts only)

---

### **4. Searching**


* Linear search
* Binary search
* First/last occurrence

---

### **5. Hashing**


* HashMap
* HashSet
* Frequency counting
* Duplicates
* Union/Intersection

---

### **6. Two Pointer Technique**


* Pair sum
* Move zeros
* Remove duplicates

---

### **7. Prefix Sum**


* Range-sum problems
* Subarray sum logic

---

### **8. Stack**


* Valid parentheses
* Reverse string
* Postfix/prefix basics

---

### **9. Queue & Deque**


* FIFO logic
* Sliding window optimization (concept)

---

### **10. Recursion (Basics Only)**


* Factorial
* Fibonacci
* Call stack concept

⛔ Skip Backtracking.

---

### **11. Bit Manipulation (Basics Only)**

* AND / OR / XOR
* Check odd/even
* Swap numbers
* 2–3 problems

---

## ⚠️ Optional (Concept Only)

### **Linked List**

* Learn the idea of nodes
* Singly LL — insert/delete
* Reverse LL (concept)

(Watch 3–4 videos • read 3 articles)

---

### **Heap**

* Min-heap / Max-heap
* Priority queue uses
* (No need to solve all problems)

---

## ❌ Not Required for Data Analysts

Skip these — not used in DA interviews:

* Trees
* BST
* Graphs
* Dynamic Programming
* Backtracking
* Tries
* Advanced recursion
* Matrix (full chapter — optional)
